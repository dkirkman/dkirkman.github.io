I specialize in\nscientific computing, statistics, data visualization, and high\nperformance and/or low latency systems.  Nowadays I mostly use c++\nin the day job, but I also have a long history with functional\nprogramming — first with lisp and more recently with haskell.</p>\n<p>I think I started being a data scientist a couple of decades before it\nwas cool, but at the time I just called it being an astronomer.  I\nstill spend a fair amount of time time wrangling data.  I generally do\nraw exploration with python and <a href="http://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a>, and\nswitch to python/c++ as the processes become productionized.</p>\n<p>I’ve been building basic dashboards with vanilla JS and\n<a href="https://d3js.org/">d3</a> for a couple of years, but more recently I’ve\nbecome interested in moving more data visualization projects into\njavascript.  This blog is an outgrowth of that, and will probably\nstart out by focusing on various visualization topics that I’ve been\nthinking about.</p>\n<p>This blog is generated with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">gatsby</a>.
