But through it all I’ve\nbeen a developer specializing in what might broadly be called\nscientific computing — high performance and low latency systems,\nstatistics, model building, parameter estimation, data wrangling and\nvisualization.</p>\n<p>I think I started being a data scientist a couple of decades before it\nwas cool, but at the time I just called it being an astronomer.  I\nstill spend a fair amount of time time in close contact with data.  I\ngenerally do raw exploration with python and\n<a href="http://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a> (with a love/hate relationship to\njupyter), and switch to python/c++ as the processes become\nproductionized.</p>\n<p>I’ve been building basic dashboards with vanilla JS and\n<a href="https://d3js.org/">d3</a> for a couple of years, but more recently I’ve\nbecome interested in moving more data visualization projects into\njavascript.  This blog is an outgrowth of that, and will probably\nstart out by focusing on various visualization topics that I’ve been\nthinking about.</p>\n<p>This blog is generated with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">gatsby</a>.
